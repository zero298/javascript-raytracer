**JavaScript Raytracer**

The documentation for this application is located in a submodule so if you want 
to also pull that, make sure that you navigate to the root of the project and do:

* `git submodule init` - which will cause the submodule to be initialized
* `git submodule update` - which will clone the documentation into your local copy
